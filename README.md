This repository serves as a library of reusable code snippets for Rust projects.

**Recommended usage:** Instead of adding this project as a direct dependency, 
it is advised to copy the specific utility functions you need into your own project. 
This approach helps keep your dependencies minimal and gives you full control over the code.

## Usage as a Direct Dependency
If you prefer to use this project as a direct dependency, you can add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```shell
cargo add sniplets
```
